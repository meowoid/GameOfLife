The getSound method returns a SineWaveSound object for a given state of the game of life.
It takes in as the parameters, the population and the double and calculates the frequency
using simple algebra. Every 8 generations, a low frequency is used for the SineWaveSound
to simulate a bass drum using generation modulo 8 = 0. Every generation after that one, a lower
frequency is used to simulate a double bass with a lower frequency. Otherwise, a simple 
multiplication and modulo is done on the population and generation to simulate a melody depending
on the game of life.

The makeTune method takes a game state, number of generations to use and the filename of the 
tune. An AudioSequence object is created and SineWaveSounds are added to the appropriate 
timeslices using a for loop to go through the first 'rep' states. To add further music
to the tune, after generation 60, additional high frequency SineWaveSound is added to the
timeslice for 10 generaions, every 10 generations/10 modulo 10.
