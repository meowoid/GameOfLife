int b; 		// create a variable called b
b = 50; 	// set b to 50
int a; 		// create a variable called a
a = b; 		// set variable a to the value stored in variable b
System.out.println(a); //print a value, 50 which is what b was set to.

Prints out '10' and on a new line '9'. This is because post-decrement is used
so it outputs the intial value of 10, decrements the value and then prints the
new value of j which is 10-1 = 9.

(i)
int c = 4;
System.out.println(0x55>>c); // Outputs 5.

(ii)
int d = 7;
System.out.println(0x55<<d); //Outputs 10880

5.
It appends n 0s to the 1 as the 1 is shifted left. This means the one is in the
2^n place and all the other bits are zero.
