A GUI implementation of Conway's Game of Life


My first Java project was to code the famous one-player finite automata by Conway.
Uses Java Swing for the GUI interface in tick 7.

Extra features include
-an audio representation generator (*.wav)
-a *.gif generator
-a real-time GUI statistics side panel
